Inserting the output of a command into the file.
This is done as follows :

    :r! command 

Example

    :r! date 

yy - Yank line into main buffer

							*:hide*
:hid[e]		Quit current window, unless it is the last window on the
		window editing it or 'bufhidden' is "unload" or "delete").
		If the window is the last one in the current tab page the tab
		page is closed. |tab-page|
		The value of 'hidden' is irrelevant for this command.
		Changes to the buffer are not written and won't get lost, so
		this is a "safe" command.
"ayy - Yank line into a buffer
"ap  - Paste from "a" bufer

"byy - Yank line into "b" buffer
"bp  - Paste from "b" buffer.

You can have a-z buffers.

"byy - Yank line into "b" buffer

TODO: find out how to use A and B buffers -- those can be pasted from
one window to the other.
